Need to create a scanner class that accepts string values
Print or println statements that prompts user for needed values
Constructor that accepts those two parameters
Method that extracts the two integers inside of the string given
Methods that calculate distance, slope, Y-value

LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - represents 1st x-coordinate
    private int x2 - represents 2nd x-coordinate
    private int y1 - represents 1st y-coordinate
    private int y2 - represents 2nd y-coordinate
    private double m - represents the slope of the line
    private double b - represents the y-intercept / how much is added onto mx.
    private double distance - represents the distance between coordinate 1 and coordinate 2
    private String equation - represents the equation that represents the line of the graph/points (mx +b)


Constructor
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) inserts the x and y-coordinates (4 parameters as integers)

Methods Created/Used
    public String toString() (Will display the information needed(First pair, second pair, slope, y-intercept,
        slope-intersect form, distance) (Created)
    public int calculateSlope() (Using the two coordinates points, will find and return slope to the nearest
        hundredth using variable m) (Created)
    public double calculateDistance() (Will use distance formula with the two coordinates to return distance to the
        nearest hundredth using variable d) (Created)
    public double calculateIntersect() (Will use the equation to calculate what y would be at x = 0.) (Created)
    public String slopeIntersectForm() (Will create an equation in y = mx + b form)
    public double calculateY() (Given the x-coordinate, will use the equation to find y value and return (x,y) (Created)
    public int findGCD(int n1, int n2) (Given the numerator (n1) and denominator (n2) of a fraction, will
        calculate its gcd) (Created)
    public String decimalToFraction() (Will convert a decimal, assuming it's in the hundredths place, to a
        fraction in form of a string) (Created)
    IndexOf(,) (Will find the comma that separates the two coordinates)
    length() (Will find the length of string given)
    substring(int from, int to) (Will extract each integer by using the index of the comma has a start/end)


Step 1: Create a new scanner class called myObj.
Step 2: Ask user to enter the first coordinate point.
Step 3: Put user input into a string variable called firstCoordinate.
Step 4: Find the index of the comma inside of the firstCoordinate variable and initialize it into comma.
Step 5: With comma, use substring method to take out the x-value from firstCoordinate and initialize it into x1.
Step 6: With comma, use substring method to take out the y-value from firstCoordinate and initialize it into y1.
Step 7: Ask user to enter the second coordinate point
Step 8: Put user input into a string variable called secondCoordinate
Step 9: Find the index of the comma inside of the firstCoordinate variable and initialize it into comma2.
Step 10: With comma2, use substring method to take out the x-value from secondCoordinate and initialize it into x2.
Step 11: With comma2, Use substring method to take out the y-value from secondCoordinate and initialize it into y2.
Step 12: Create a LinearEquation object using the four variables as inputs
Step 13: Use the method toString() to inside of a print statement in order to print the needed information of the line.
    toString() should use the other methods in order to find needed information and put it into a single string.
Step 14: Ask user to enter a x-value
Step 15: Use .calculateY, inside of a print statement, to calculate y-value and print out (x,y) as a string.

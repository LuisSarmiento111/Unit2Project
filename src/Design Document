Need to create a scanner class that accepts string values
Print or println statements that prompts user for needed values
Constructor that accepts those two parameters
Method that extracts the two integers inside of the string given
Methods that calculate distance, slope, Y-value

LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - represents 1st x-coordinate
    private int x2 - represents 2nd x-coordinate
    private int y1 - represents 1st y-coordinate
    private int y2 - represents 2nd y-coordinate
    private double m - represents the slope of the line
    private double b - represents the y-intercept / how much is added onto mx.
    private double d - represents the distance between coordinate 1 and coordinate 2
    private String equation - represents the equation that represents the line of the graph/points (mx +b)

Constructor
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) -accepts the x and y-coordinate (4 parameters)

Methods Created/Used
    public String toString() (Will display the information needed(First pair, second pair, slope, y-intercept,
    slope-intersect form, distance) (Created)
    public int calculateSlope() (Using the two coordinates points, will find and return slope to the nearest
        hundredth using variable m) (Created)
    public double calculateDistance() (Will use distance formula with the two coordinates to return distance to the
        nearest hundredth using variable d) (Created)
    public double calculateY() (Given the x-coordinate, will use the equation to find y value and return (x,y) (Created)
    IndexOf(,) (Will find the comma that separates the two coordinates)
    length() (Will find the length of string given)
    substring(int from, int to) (Will extract each integer by using the index of the comma has a start/end



Step 1: Ask user to enter the first coordinate point
Step 2: Ask user to enter the second coordinate point
Step 3: Initialize variables x1, x2, y1, y2 to their respected values
Step 4: Create a LinearEquation object using the variables
Step 5: Use the method .calculateDistance to find distance and initialize variable d to value
Step 6: Use the method .calculateSlope to find slope and initialize variable m to value
Step 7: Initialize variable equation using slope and y-intercept
Step 8: Use toString() method to print out following information (First pair, second pair, slope, y-intercept slope-intersect form, distance)
Step 9 Ask user to enter a x-value
Step 10: Use .calculateY to return (x,y) inside of a print statement
